# package_01

- write a package `mypkg` that contains `module1`, with a function `bar()`, and `module2`, with a function `foo()`. Each function must print its name.
- import and use the functions.
- try to **import the package** itself. What happens?
- after that you import **only** the package `mypkg`, can you use the functions or the modules?
